# APL for Audio Template

This template is built on top of Node.js SDK. It's pretty simple, as on this demo i have demonstrated the Audio functionality in APL that uses Mixer, with filters. To use this -

#### Step 1  
Navigate to your [Amazon Alexa Developer Console](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa/console/ask) .

#### Step 2 
Click on New Skill

#### Step 3 
Give your desired Skill name, for eg: Demo Audio, Choose Custom Model, Choose Node.js SDK in methods.

#### Step 4 
Click on the "import skill" button, and copy the link to this Github Repo i.e - https://github.com/dabblelab/apla-template.git

#### Step 5 
Once Validation & Model Creation is done, Your skill would be ready.

#### Step 6 
Make sure you format your audio files properly with SSML standard protocols & upload them to your s3 hosted skill bucket. If you are not sure about audio formatting, you can check this [here](https://github.com/dabblelab/dabble-alexa-with-sohini/blob/main/E03-alexa-skill-using-audio-files/Audio%20Formatting%20with%20Audacity.md) for Audacity. And using FFMPEG, you can do the same, check this out [here](https://github.com/dabblelab/dabble-alexa-with-sohini/blob/main/E03-alexa-skill-using-audio-files/Audio%20Formatting%20with%20FFMPEG.md) Try to name the audio files without spaces in them inorder to prevent errors. 

#### Step 7 
Once, this is done, you've successfully covered all the steps to test this template. Hence, move to the test tab, and turn your skill mode from "Off" to "Development", and give it a test! 

NOTE: I have some formatted audio files in the Assets Folder, you may use them for your reference/testing.

These were the basic steps to help you with the skill. If you wish to further use this for building a skill, you can manipulate the template accordingly. Further to this, if you have any questions, reach out to me at - sohini@dabblelab.com or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TheSohini)
